Hello. I am Jagjeet.

Nice to meet you!

This is my new portfolio so it's 'Under Construction' for the more nostalgic. I love writing and art and design and development and the intersection of all those things. My goal is to help make the world a fun, weird place. Hopefully, this serves as a representation of that. In job speak that translates to "I have experience as a Writer, Designer, Intermediate Full Stack Engineer, Senior QA Engineer and Non-Technical Manager."

Currently, I am looking for Intermediate Full Stack or Senior QA Engineering roles. I am open to remote positions, relocation and/or  positions in Sacramento and the East Bay. While I am currently located in Vacaville, for most job related purposes I am housing insecure. I came back from living in Mexico a few years back and have been lucky and priviledged to stay with family while working on some passion projects. I am now working a consulting position until I find something permanent and am open to restarting wherever the wind may blow.

Unless it blows to New Jersey... #SorryNotSorry #IHateNewJersey

I am interested in working with people and companies that:

* believe passion and values matter first and foremost to building great products
* are open to engineers returning to tech (tech reentry programs are awesome!)
* recognize that sometimes it takes outsiders to change things for the better
* recognize and appreciate that broadly skilled people are different kinds of experts
* value diversity and actively think about how to hire for it
* are making the web more accessible for women and minorities
* are doing interesting and artful things with technology. Some of the projects and site that interest me today are:
  * [The Boat](http://www.sbs.com.au/theboat/) - A site pushing the limits of how we think of storytelling on the web.
  * [Newsela](https://newsela.com/) - A site pushing how we think of learning on the web. As someone who has used Spanish RSS feeds to retain and learn Spanish, tools like this is incredibly exciting.
  * [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) and [Lingvist](https://lingvist.com/) - More sites dedicated to language learning that have really shaped how I think of learning today and in the future.
  * [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) - Pushing how we think of browsing the web. It makes me think what could a browser for a developer look like? What about a scientist? Or a doctor?
  * [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) - Integrating a code playground and art in ways that excite me.
  * [SciHub](https://sci-hub.tw/) - Science has failed to keep up with the times of accessing information. While pirating is arguably not the best answer, having scientific papers at your fingertips is mindboggling.

If any of that resonates with you, I would love to talk more. More to be added soon! Thanks for visiting!
