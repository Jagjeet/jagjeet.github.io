Hello. I am Jagjeet. Nice to meet you!

This is my new portfolio so it's 'Under Construction' for the more nostalgic. I love writing and art and design and development and the intersection of all those things. My goal is to help make the world a fun, weird place. Hopefully, this serves as a representation of that.

I am interested in working with people and companies that:

* believe passion and values matter first and foremost to building great products
* recognize that sometimes it takes outsiders to change things for the better
* recognize that broadly skilled people are different kinds of experts
* are doing interesting and artful things with technology. Some of the projects that interest me today are:
  * [Newsela](https://newsela.com/)
  * [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) and [Lingvist](https://lingvist.com/)
  * [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/)
  * [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)
  * [SciHub](https://sci-hub.tw/)
* value diversity and actively think about how to hire for it
* are making the web more accessible for women and minorities

If any of that resonates with you, I would love to talk more as I am actively pursuing new opportunities. More to be added soon! Thanks for visiting!
